Project Exhibhition 2 - DSN2009 WEEKLY REPORT

# Day 1: 12/11/22: Planning and Research
Today, we spent some time brainstorming ideas for the hand gesture game. We researched existing games to get inspiration and ideas. We also started thinking about the mechanics of the game and how it could be played.

# Day 2: 19/11/22: Sketching and Prototyping
We spent today sketching out some rough designs for the game and making some initial prototypes. We tested out some different hand gestures and thought about how they could be incorporated into the game.

# Day 3-4: 26/11/22: Coding the Basic Game Mechanics
We spent the next couple of days coding the basic mechanics of the game. This included creating the game board, setting up the player's hand gestures, and programming the rules for how the game would be played. We used Python, Turtle & OpenCV to achieve our objective.

# Day 5-6: 03/12/22: Creating the machine learning & training data set
We focused on creating the training data set for the game, designing the layout of the screen, and making sure the game was easy to comprehend.

# Day 7-8: 10/12/22: Labelling the data set
Today, we used the premade model of a dataset from mediapipe & used “LabelMe” software to label them as there were huge errors & inconsistency in the data that we created.

# Day 9-10: 17/12/22: Testing and Debugging - 1
Today, we tested the game to make sure it was functioning correctly. we fixed any bugs or glitches that we found and made sure the game was balanced and fair.

# Day 11-12: 24/12/22: Testing and Debugging - 2
Today, we tested the training data set & connectivity with the game to make sure it was functioning correctly. We improved the connectivity a bit & fixed any bugs or glitches that we found and made sure the game was balanced and fair.

# Day 11-12: 24/12/22: Polishing the Game
We spent the next couple of days polishing the game, adding finishing touches, and making sure everything was perfect.

# Day 13-14: 31/12/22: Playtesting
we invited some friends and family to playtest the game and provide feedback. we used this feedback to make some final adjustments to the game.

# Day 15-16: 07/01/23: Creating Help Materials
We created some help materials to guide players through the game and help them understand how to play.

# Day 17-18: 14/01/23: Final Update on GitHub
We updated all the files on GitHub in the main branch.
